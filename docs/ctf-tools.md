# Tools for CTFs

A lot of the tools I use are built into the Kali Linux operating system. Most of these will be Linux commands.


## Forensics / Steganography

* Exiftool - prints out metadata from an image 

* Exif - prints out metadata as well 

* Hexeditor - you can use this to "repair" an image by editing the file signatures of a file

* Strings -  allows you to see all the letters in a file

* Stegsolve - a steganography tool written in java for finding hidden text in images

  * Can be found at [https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Stegsolve](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Stegsolve)

* Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit - Another tool written in java for finding hidden text in images

  * Can be found at [http://diit.sourceforge.net](http://diit.sourceforge.net)

* Autopsy - digital forensic software for disk imaging

  * Can be found at [https://www.autopsy.com](https://www.autopsy.com)

* Binwalk - you are able to see and extract hidden files in a file

* zsteg - detect stegano-hidden data in PNG & BMP

  * Can be found at [https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg](https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg)

* Foremost - recover files using the file headers

* jstego - hide and seek secret information to/from JPEG images.

## Reverse Engineering



* ltrace - simple command for viewing what is going on in the background of a binary file

* IDA Freeware - A debugger which reveals all the behind the scenes for a binary file

* Ghidra - a debugger, which attempts to reconstruct code from where the binary was composed of
