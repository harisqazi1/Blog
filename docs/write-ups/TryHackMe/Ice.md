```c
sudo nmap -sS -p- 10.10.158.64 -oN nmap_syn
```

I then got this output for it after 14 minutes:

```c
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-05-26 00:10 EDT

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 871.23 seconds
```

For the nmap, I would recommend using something like:

```c
sudo nmap -T4 -A -sS -p- <ip\_address> -oN output
```

The reason for this is that with this, you would get more information about the software running than just the names of the services.

**QUESTION: What port is this open on?**

> **3389**
