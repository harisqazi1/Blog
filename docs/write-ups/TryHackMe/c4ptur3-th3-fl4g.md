### This is a write-up for the TryHackMe room located at: [https://tryhackme.com/room/c4ptur3th3fl4g](https://tryhackme.com/room/c4ptur3th3fl4g)

This seems to be in leetspeak format. I manually was able to convert it, but you can use a website such as [this one](https://www.dcode.fr/leet-speak-1337) to decode it. I then got the flag:

```aspnet

```

This seems to be in binary format. I looked for a binary to ASCII converter online.

```

To me, this seemed to be Base32 or Base64. I tried Base64 and it did not work. I then tried Base32, I then got the flag:

![](https://github.com/harisqazi1/blog/blob/main/assets/Pasted%20image%2020210621191333.png?raw=true)

```aspnet

```

For this one, the last two characters "\=\=" led me to believe that this was Base64, and this led me to get the flag:

```

To me, my first thought was this could be hex because of the "3f" at the end. My intuition was correct, and I got the flag:

```aspnet

For this, I tried ROT13, and got it on the first run:

For this one, I used [this writeup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3jucz07V68) to get help for it and found out it was rot47:

![](https://github.com/harisqazi1/blog/blob/main/assets/Pasted%20image%2020210621191805.png?raw=true)

```aspnet
- . .-.. . -.-. --- -- -- ..- -. .. -.-. .- - .. --- -.. -. -.-. --- -.. .. -. --.​
```

This seemed to be morse code for me. It was!:

```aspnet

```

For this CTF, I assumed that this would be ASCII because of the numbers above 100. I got the flag after I entered this into an online decoder:

For this one, I got some help from [this writeup](https://embeddedworld.home.blog/2019/08/14/hacking-walkthrough-another-ctf-challenge/). This one had multiple ciphers in it.

1. Base64
2. Morse Code
3. Binary to ascii
4. ROT47
5. ASCII \(or BCD\) to text

This led me to the answer:

## Task 2: Spectrograms

The hint for this message was Audacity. I then downloaded Audacity, and then got the flag:

![](https://github.com/harisqazi1/blog/blob/main/assets/Pasted%20image%2020210621192140.png?raw=true)

## Task 3: Steganography

For this problem, I did get stuck and used a hint from [here](https://embeddedworld.home.blog/2019/08/14/hacking-walkthrough-another-ctf-challenge/). I then typed in the command:

```aspnet
steghide extract -sf <filename>.jpg
```

It then asked me for a password. I just pressed **ENTER** and then it allowed me to get a file that had a flag in it:

![](https://github.com/harisqazi1/blog/blob/main/assets/Pasted%20image%2020210621192222.png?raw=true)

## Task 4: Security through obscurity

The image by itself shows this:

![](https://github.com/harisqazi1/blog/blob/main/assets/Pasted%20image%2020210621192306.png?raw=true)

I then used the following command to find a couple files:

```aspnet
foremost -i <filename>
```

This led me to find these files:

That eventually did not lead me anywhere. **HOWEVER,** when I ran the **strings** command on the file, I got the answers needed for the CTF:
