# Homelab v1

## Introduction

I wanted to build a Homelab for myself in order to get enterprise experience without having an enterprise-caliber occupation. I then started doing research and asking around until I found a setup that worked for me. This write-up is my journey through creating the Homelab.

## Step 1: Firewall 

I setup the firewall first, since all of the data was going to go through the Firewall. I used [Michael Bazzell's Book](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Privacy-What-Takes-Disappear/dp/B094LDWKGZ/) in order to setup pfSense on my Protectli Vault. The steps (for me) were as follows:

- Installation
	- www.pfsense.org/download
	- Architecture: AMD64 | Installer: USB Memstick Installer | Console: VGA | Mirror: New York
	- Download the .gz file and decompress it
		- You can use 7-zip for this
		- You should end up with a "pfSense......-amd64.img" file
	- Download Rufus or Etcher (flashing programs)
	- Flash the pfSense file onto a USB device
	- Power down Vault, if not powered down already
	- Connect a USB keyboard and monitor to the Vault
	- Insert USB into another USB port
	- Power on the device
	- Enter in all the defaults
	- After the installation is complete, disconnect USB keyboard and Monitor
	- Go to 192.168.1.1 -> user:admin / password:pfsense
	- Click Advanced to allow the page to load
	- Accept all defaults by clicking "Next", "Close", and "Finish"
- Activate Ports (only applicable for 4-port & 6-port)
	-
