# Introduction

#### Currently a cybersecurity student at a University. Interested in ethical hacking in general, whether it is hardware or software. Enjoy doing CTF \(Capture-The-Flag\) cybersecurity challenges in my free time. Hope to become a Cybersecurity Professional post-graduation.

## My Hacking Mentality: Everything is hackable, you just have to find the right vulnerability
